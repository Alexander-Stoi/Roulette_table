(GET all bets, POST new bet)\r - Bets should have an amount, betType, status (active/completed)\r - Bet Type can be exact number, 1-18, 19-36, 1st 12, 2nd 12 or 3rd 12\r - Create a Game route that handles a call that triggers a game. (Generate a number between 1 and 36)\r - After the Game is calculated, check all active bets and calculate winnings accordingly (x2 of the amount that was bet), as well as put all active bets status to completed.\r - Feel free to experiment with this one :)",
